# DC-DC Converter Specs Calculator

This a DC-DC converter specification calculator streamlit app which:
 - Calculates key specs like `critical inductance`, `CCM inductance`, & `output capacitance` values. 
 - Along with converter's `Line-to-Output (Gvg)` & `Control-to-Output (Gvd)` transfer function.
 - Also plots the `Line-to-Output (Gvg)` as well as `Control-to-Output (Gvd)` transient responses. 
 - Provided with inputs like input & output voltages, load resistance, operating frequency, inductor ripple current precentage, & output voltage ripple percentage. 
 - And calculation history is available to download!
